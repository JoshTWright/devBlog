Learn to use postgres basics to get you up and running.

Learning to use postgres in CPSC 350 was not an easy task, on the same note it was not incredibly difficult because of the good notes i took. In this post we will be going over some basic postgres knowledge and commands that will show you how to get a simple database set up and will show you which commands will be helpful to you when first starting out.

In this tutorial i will be using the Cloud9 ide or C9 for short, i have a tutorial on how to setup a basic C9 workspace if that is of interest to you.


Starting out we will want to navigate to our terminal on C9 and enter the following command.
