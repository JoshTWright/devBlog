Learn to use postgres basics to get you up and running.



In this post we will be going over some basic postgres knowledge and commands that will show you how to get a simple database set up and will show you which commands will be helpful to you when first starting out.I will be using the Cloud9 ide or C9 for short, i have a tutorial on how to setup a basic C9 workspace if that is of interest to you.

The following command will acomplish this task.
