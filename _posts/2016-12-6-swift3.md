title: Changes with swift 3
---

Interested in seeing some of the recent changes in the swift 3 update from Apple.inc?

For starters Apple changed a lot in the transition from Swift 1 to Swift 2, and they have done it once again. There are some pretty small changes but they have a big effect in migration from one version of the language to the other.

In swift 3 unless otherwise stated labels are now required, method names lose their detail but get shorter, and the detail is often moved inside the parenthesis and becomes the first parameters name.


![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/s1.png)

>^This details how the details of what is being done is sort of shifted around, this change tightens up the code and makes it more concise

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/s2.png)

>^Another good example of a similar situation, 'scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval' becomes 'scheduledTimer' and timeInterval moves in to be the first parameters name.
