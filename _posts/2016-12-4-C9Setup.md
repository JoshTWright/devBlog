Setup a C9 workspace

Once you have signed up for an account with C9.io you earn the ability to start creating workspaces, think of workspaces like containers where you can store related files and code for projects, you can create as many public workspaces as you would like but as a free user you may only have ONE private workspace.

We give out workspace a name, and a creative description, aswell as choose whether we want a private/public workspace and we then choose our template. We are also given the option to clone from Git or Mercurial URL's.

## Templates in detail
Templates in C9 are a way to remove much of the headache that comes when setting up enviornments, these template workspaces come preloaded with almost all of what you will need to get off the ground and running with your projects. Lets take a closer look.
