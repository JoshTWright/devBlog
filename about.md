I am currently attending the University Of Mary Washington with a major Computer Science and a minor in Data Science. I have created this blog as a way of keeping good notes of things that i think may be of use to me in the future. The notes are writen in a way so that others may be able to learn and grow their knowledge base from what i have provieded.

### More Information

I graduated from Spotsylvania High School in 2013, then i started attending classes at Germanna Community College the following fall. It was in my last semester at Germanna that i realized my deep love and interest with computers and technology in gerneral. I hope to be finished with my degree by spring 2018.
